    <p>Viva la Vida. Viva la Naturaleza. No danemos el planeta tierra. Porque el planeta tierra es hogar de muchos.</p>
    <h2>Hue</h2>
    <p>The attribute of a color by virtue of which it is discernible as red, green, etc., and which is dependent on its dominant wavelength and independent of intensity or lightness.</p>
    <h2>Brightness</h2>
    <p>Brightness refers to how much light appears to shine from something. This is a different perception than lightness, which is how light something appears compared to a similarly lit white object.</p>
    <h2>Culture</h2>
    <p>The customary beliefs, social forms, and material traits of a racial, religious, or social group. It can also be the characteristic features of everyday existence (such as diversions or a way of life) shared by people in a place or time.</p>
    <h2>Saturation</h2>
    <p>Saturation means holding as much moisture as possible. When you water your houseplants, you may soak them until the soil around each plant reaches saturation. The noun saturation means the act of completely soaking something until it's absorbed as much water as it can.</p>
    <h2>Color</h2>
    <p>Color in art is the light reflected off an object that creates a sensation in the viewer's eyes. </p>
    <h2>Sensation</h2>
    <p>Provoking sights, strokes, savors, sounds, and smells, these artists activate the senses to place audiences in an experiential state. </p>
    <h2>Sounds</h2>
    <p>Sound art is a form of artistic expression where sound serves as the central medium and material. In sound art, anything that makes noise can be part of an artwork. </p>
    <h2>Strokes</h2>
    <p>A stroke is somewhere between a tip, a full-brush blob and an extended line, or all of the above. Some strokes can go from one side of a work to the other, while others are minor, sinuous, or mere wisps of non-entity.</p>
    <h2>Sights</h2>
    <p>When a framed two-dimensional work of art can not be removed from its frame for measuring, the measurements are taken to the sight edges and are said to be 'sight' measurements. </p>
