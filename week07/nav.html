				<h2>What they are?</h2>
				<p style="font-size:20px;">&rArr; Auroras are beautiful, dynamic displays of light that occur in the night sky, predominantly around the polar regions (Arctic and Antarctic). 
					<h2>What Causes them:</h2>
					<p style="font-size:20px;">&rArr; The sun constantly emits a stream of charged particles called the solar wind. 
					When these particles interact with Earth's magnetic field, some are guided towards the poles. 
					These particles then collide with atoms and molecules in the upper atmosphere (the ionosphere), causing them to become excited and emit light. 
					The colors of the aurora depend on the type of gas molecules involved and the altitude at which the collisions occur.</p> 
					
					<h2>Types of Auroras</h2>
					<p style="font-size:20px;">&rArr; Aurora Borealis: The Northern Lights, seen in the northern hemisphere. 
					Aurora Australis: The Southern Lights, seen in the southern hemisphere.</p>
					<h2>COLORS:</h2>
					<p style="font-size:20px;">&rArr; Green is the most common color, often caused by oxygen atoms at lower altitudes. 
					Red can appear when oxygen atoms are at higher altitudes. 
					Blue and purple can also occur, but are less common.</p> 
					<h2>Where to see them:</h2>
					<p style="font-size:20px;">&rArr; Auroras are most visible in high-latitude regions, near the magnetic poles.</p> 
					<h2> Best time to see them:</h2>
					<p style="font-size:20px;">&rArr;The best time to see the aurora is during periods of high solar activity, which can lead to more intense and frequent displays. </p>
