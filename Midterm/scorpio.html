            <h2> Scorpio (Constellation) </h2>
            <p>&#9658; Scorpius is one of the 13 constellations of the zodiac. &#9668;</p>
 <p>&#9658; It is one of the brightest constellations in the night sky. The name is Latin for scorpion, or literally translated as the "creature with the burning sting." &#9668;</p>
 <p>&#9658; You can see all or some of Scorpius from the Southern Hemisphere and much of the mid-Northern Hemisphere between May and August. While it appears high in the sky in the center of the Milky Way in the Southern Hemisphere, it is close to the southern hemisphere in places where it is visible in the Northern Hemisphere. Because of its unusual shape and relative brightness, Scorpius is not difficult to spot. In either hemisphere, the best time to view the constellation is July and August, and it is at its highest point around 9 pm in mid-July. &#9668;</p>
<p>&#9658; Scorpius has 18 named stars, including Antares, the so-called "rival of Mars," a red giant star named for its bright hue, and Shaula and Lesath, sometimes called the "Cat's Eyes" because they are so close together. It also has 14 stars known to have planets orbiting them. One of these, PSR B1620-26 b, is nicknamed "Methuselah" because of its extreme old age. It's estimated to be 12.2 billion years old, plus or minus a billion years (for comparison, the universe is estimated to be about 13.8 billion years old). &#9668;</p>
